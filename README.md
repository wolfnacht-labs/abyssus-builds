FAQ
* Why doesn't the website use an account system? <br>
  I intentionally chose not to implement user accounts to prioritize privacy and security. By avoiding account systems, I eliminate concerns about data breaches, email leaks, and the need to handle sensitive user     information. This approach keeps the site simple, secure, and focused on what matters most: the builds themselves.
* Why is the website using fingerprinting?<br>
  Fingerprinting is a safe and industry-standard practice used to identify browsers without storing personal data. Since the website doesn't use accounts, it instead uses browser fingerprinting to track likes and prevent abuse. This method stores only a hash of your browser characteristics locally - no sensitive information is collected or stored on any third-party server.
* How can I suggest changes?<br>
  Join the Abyssus Wiki Discord server and head to the #builds-general channel to share your ideas and discuss builds with other community members.
* Is the website monetized or using ads?<br>
  No. Itâ€™s ad-free and maintained using free-tier infrastructure and open web services.
